02:38:26	vasumathy mohan:	is it possible to improve the accuracy of output when colab codings are used for my dataset
02:38:28	Harman Singh:	which is better spyder, jupyter notebook or colab
02:38:35	ALOK TIWARI:	u misunderstood my point sir... i was asking about giving path to use the data... you've to first load it into drive and then use or load in current window... so... it'll take lots of data to train... 
02:39:15	SRIMATHI KANNAN:	For real time computer vision projects , if we want to create a dataset of our own, how can we form a dataset and store as a trained dataset, so that we can use it further â€¦.is there any examples available....This project is mainly on inspection basis...
02:39:28	ParvathSuman K:	As like python wheather it is possible to get the Overall statistics and class statistics (Performance Metric) in R programming for CNN 
02:39:56	Ridhima Rani:	sir, is authenticity get maintained on colab by creating account? suppose some one wants to run research related codes on it.
02:40:35	SAI KRISHNA KODALI:	for medical image processing, which algorithm is better
02:40:41	Srinivasa KG:	https://colab.research.google.com/github/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/05.06-Linear-Regression.ipynb
02:41:04	Shankar Pasa:	feedback pla
02:42:00	jensila smile:	For hybrid computing is it possible ?
02:42:30	Seetharaman K S:	can colab be used for live streaming data and its analysis... some examples please
02:42:57	vasumathy mohan:	is it possible to improve the accuracy of output when colab codings are used for my dataset
02:42:57	Madhusudhana Subramanyam:	feedback link
02:43:35	Madhusudhana Subramanyam:	for validation testing we need all features using which we have trained
